------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Nine Springs neighborhood is located on the South side of Madison, with easy access to the Downtown, East side, West side, and I-90. Nine Springs is primarily a neighborhood of single family homes with condos and apartments in the area as well.

Nine Springs has close proximity to the Nine Springs E-Way system, from which our neighborhood derives it's name, along with Capital Springs State Park, the Capital City State Trail, and numerous parks allows residents to enjoy both the urban and natural settings of the city.

As a neighborhood, we seek to create a sustainable, thriving home for our residents via community engagement. Together, we can maintain and improve the quality of life for all of the residents of the neighborhood.
