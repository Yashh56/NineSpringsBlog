Hello and welcome to Toad Hollow!
A plant nursery and gardens with over 3 acres of plants in the Madison and Spring Green areas.
Perennials and Wisconsin wildflowers have been a passion of our family for over three generations. 
They are a small individually owned  business that sells at the Middleton Farmers Market, local events, seasonal yard sales and site visits by appointment.
Along with plant stock,they also sell planting accessories, nature photography prints, local artist paintings,  floral arrangements and vintage botanical antiques.
