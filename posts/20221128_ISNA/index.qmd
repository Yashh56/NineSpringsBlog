# Minutes of the ISNA Quarterly Meeting 11/28/22

Neighborhood meetings will move to a bi-monthly schedule with the next neighborhood meeting (of Nine Springs? ISNA?) to be scheduled for 01/30/23 at 7PM.

### Open Positions:

-   Secretary (duties involve taking notes during meetings, submitting for posting to the Nine Springs blog)

-   Web Editor/Content Moderator (duties involve finding and/or posting content to the Nine Springs blog, helping to maintain blog)

-   Nine Springs Childcare Coordinator (duties involve facilitating meetings as Nine Springs Childcare group forms and helping to connect participating families)

### Coffee Meetup update

Meetups will change to a schedule of 1st and 3rd Saturdays of every month at Finca Coffee from 10am-12pm. Kevin K will update and continue to post on NextDoor the week prior to continue to inform community.

### To Do:

-   Update ISNA Meeting calendar events, post to the Nine Springs calendar, and change meeting coordinator to Courtney K

-   Inform City of Madison about new Nine Springs Blog page and determine contact necessary to open a discussion about neighborhood boundaries. None of the neighborhoods in the Rimrock/Beltline corner of Madison have an active neighborhood association so there is the potential to combine to increase potential membership around the shared location.

-   Contact former ISNA Treasurer for information about the ISNA account to ensure funds are properly migrated.
