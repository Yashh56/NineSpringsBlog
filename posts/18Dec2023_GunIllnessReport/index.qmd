# Gun Violence Report Released

We released a new data snapshot on gun violence in Dane County this fall. Providing updated data helps our Violence Prevention team and community partners make decisions about priorities, and advocate for policy changes. Learn more about the data by [checking out the report](https://publichealthmdc.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcc6f50df19aeec2fd56eb1fa&id=42ffa0ada0&e=c6e84a2fc6). Please note that this report contains data on sensitive topics, including suicide. 

# **Dane County Respiratory Dashboard Launched**

We launched the new [Dane County Respiratory Illness Dashboard](https://publichealthmdc.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dcc6f50df19aeec2fd56eb1fa&id=8f2c6268fa&e=c6e84a2fc6) in October. This dashboard blends many data sources together to convey, in as real-time as possible, the current state of respiratory viruses in our community. Get main takeaways like levels and trends of COVID and flu, and trends in other respiratory viruses, including the common cold rhinovirus. We're also collaborating with researchers to give you some cutting-edge data on school absences and results from using air sampling machines!
