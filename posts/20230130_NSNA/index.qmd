# Minutes of the Nine Springs Neighborhood Meeting 30Jan2023

-   Web Editor/Content Moderator (duties involve finding and/or posting content to the Nine Springs blog, helping to maintain blog)

-   Nine Springs Childcare Coordinator (duties involve facilitating meetings as Nine Springs Childcare group forms and helping to connect participating families)

### Upcoming Neighborhood Events

-   Coffee Meetups continue to be held the 1st and 3rd Saturday of each month at Finca Coffee from 10am-12pm.

-   Spring Election Day 21Feb2023

### To Do:

-   Inform City of Madison about new Nine Springs Blog page and determine contact necessary to open a discussion about neighborhood boundaries. None of the neighborhoods in the Rimrock/Beltline corner of Madison have an active neighborhood association so there is the potential to combine to increase potential membership around the shared location.

-   Contact former ISNA Treasurer for information about the ISNA account to ensure funds are properly migrated.

-   Collecting information about a solar water aerator for the pond in Baxter Park. This is intended to be a semi-permanent fixture with the aim of decreasing the amount of stagnant water in the pond to cut down on the number of swarming insects in the summer months. Currently working with neighborhood volunteers to identify and purchase an aerator before installation and coordination with the Madison Parks Department.

-   Brainstorm ideas for next neighborhood meeting to increase awareness and visibility of Nine Springs Neighborhood effort to increase meeting attendance.
