Since this is the first blog post I am writing for the Nine Springs Neighborhood, the first thing I would like to do is say hello and welcome everyone to the Nine Springs Neighborhood website! I am glad to see you've joined us here and hope that you find numerous reasons amongst the resources we are assembling to continue to check back in with us.

I primarily wanted to write this quick post to announce that we are starting a bi-weekly meetup at Finca Coffee. Every other Saturday, we'll meet at 10am, grab a cup of coffee, and have a casual gathering to catch up with all of our neighbors in the Nine Springs area. I hope you will join us on the occassional Saturday and help build up our community connections - see you all at Finca!
