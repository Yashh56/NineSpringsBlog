# Inflation Reduction Act Credits

Due to the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act there has never been a better time to develop clean energy projects and improve your energy efficiency. Below highlights opportunities for homeowners that are available from the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://daneclimateaction.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ef297a18fffa10f53952dd822&id=96b2705b61&e=42879ade26) as of January 1, 2023.
