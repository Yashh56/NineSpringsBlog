Have you looked in your medicine cabinet lately? Fall is a perfect time to take a peek and get rid of any unused, unwanted or expired medicines you may find. 

Close to 50% of people who misuse prescription drugs for the first time get these medicines from people they know with or without asking, according to reports by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. And as unintentional deaths through drug poisoning exceed deaths from motor vehicle crashes in Dane County, it's a good preventative measure to dispose of medications in a timely and appropriate manner. Not to mention the importance of keeping unwanted medications out of the hands of children and out of our streams and lakes. 

The African American Opioid Coalition and Safe Communities Madison-Dane County host community drop days each spring and fall. Over the last 20 years, MedDrop collected more than 18 tons.  Products are incinerated and disposed of in the most environmentally sound method currently available.  

National Prescription Drug Take Back Day will be held on **Saturday, October 28th**. Safe Communities, the Dane County Sheriff's Office and Madison Police Department and the AAOC will be on hand from **10 a.m. to 2 p.m**. at Elver Park (1250 McKenna Blvd.), Warner Park (2930 N Sherman Ave.) and Second Baptist Church (4303 Britta Pkwy, Madison) to collect unused and unwanted medications. The AAOC will also be hosting additional take back days on select Sundays in September, October,  and November in partnership with various churches. Visit Safercommunity.net for more information.
