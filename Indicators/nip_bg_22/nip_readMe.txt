# About the Madison Neighborhood Indicators Project


## Overview

By providing users with timely and detailed information, the Madison Neighborhood Indicators Project (NIP) aims to support better understanding of the varied and changing needs of different areas within the City. It is our hope that NIP data users will use these indicators along with local knowledge and other informational resources to help all communities within Madison thrive.



## Public Input

The current roster of indicators was developed with guidance for City and community leaders. Input from users continues to help us to refine and improve the data and tools. The NIP coordinators welcome your feedback at the email addresses below:
